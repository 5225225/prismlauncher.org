At the request of Slowpoke, representing the FTB team, we have removed the feature that allows downloading FTB modpacks from Prism Launcher. [Github PR][pr-ftb-removal]

Existing instances of FTB modpacks will remain functional, but with the next release, downloading FTB packs directly will no longer be possible.

We will start working on a feature that allows importing FTB Modpacks from the FTB App, as this is acceptable to the FTB team.

The reason for this request from the FTB team seems to be related to some launchers attempting to monetize FTB Packs.

## About PolyMC

PolyMC is a custom launcher for Minecraft forked from MultiMC that allows to manage more instances at once.
While this fork was made for packaging/redistribution concerns, now this fork has a lot of more features developed by the community for the community.
In fact, unlike other launchers, PolyMC has pure freedom about redistribution: it has reproducible builds, it allows everyone to package it, and we don't care if you fork (if you respect General Public License v3).

It includes many features, such has:
- Managing multiple isolated instances of Minecraft,
- Simple access management about logs/mods and a simple way to install mods from curseforge and modrinth
- Kill Minecraft easily if it crashes / freezes.
- Unlike other launchers, PolyMC uses Qt, a simple and lightweight toolkit that doesn't use much system resources
- Easy installation of mod loaders, such as  Forge, Fabric, LiteLoader and Quilt (WIP).
- Manage your worlds and resource/texture packs with just some clicks 
- Install modpacks from many platforms such as Curseforge, Technic, FTB, Modrinth (WIP) and more
- Install individual mods to match your loader and version from Curseforge and Modrinth.
- And many, many other features

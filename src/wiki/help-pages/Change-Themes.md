Themes can help you spice up your launcher appearance.

**Prism Launcher 6.0 will add support for multiple custom themes at once**

***This section will be updated accordingly***

Some themes are only on discord for now, but we will try to transfer them to our repository.

### Themes

    - Open your local Prism Launcher Themes folder:
   
      -  on **Windows:** `%appdata%\PrismLauncher\themes`

      -  on **Mac:** `~/Library/Application Support/PrismLauncher/themes`

      -  on **Linux:** `~/.local/share/PrismLauncher/themes`

      -  on **Flatpak:** `~/.var/app/org.prismlauncher.PrismLauncher/data/PrismLauncher/themes`

- Rename the `custom` folder to whatever you want (Example `old` or `previous`).

- Unzip the theme and rename the newly added folder to `custom`.

- Restart Prism Launcher, then open the global settings. In the Launcher section, click the User Interface tab, and under Colors (make sure you're changing Colors and not Icons), choose the Custom theme. Click the Close button, and enjoy your new Prism Launcher.

In this page you can edit API-related things, like the pastebin provider and the MSA Client ID

On the "Pastebin URL" part you can set the URL to use for the pastebin service. Note that it needs to use the same format as 0x0.st, that is POST a file parameter to the URL and return a link in the return body.

On the "Microsoft Authentication" part you can set a custom MSA Client ID, if you want to.

# Development Builds

There are per-commit development builds available [here](https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC/actions). These have debug information in the binaries, so their file sizes are relatively larger.
Portable builds are provided for AppImage on Linux, Windows, and macOS.

For Debian and Arch, you can use these packages for the latest development versions:  
[![polymc-git](https://img.shields.io/badge/aur-polymc--git-blue)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/polymc-git/)
[![polymc-git](https://img.shields.io/badge/mpr-polymc--git-orange)](https://mpr.makedeb.org/packages/polymc-git)  
For flatpak, you can use [flathub-beta](https://discourse.flathub.org/t/how-to-use-flathub-beta/2111)

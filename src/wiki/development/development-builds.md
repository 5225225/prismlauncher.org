# Development Builds
Please understand that **these builds are not intended for most users**. There may be bugs, and other instabilities. You have been warned.

There are per-commit development builds available [here](https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC/actions). Debug information is present within the binaries, making their file sizes larger than otherwise normal.
Portable dev-builds are provided for Windows, macOS, and AppImage (Linux).

For Debian and Arch, you can use these packages for the latest development versions:  
[![polymc-git](https://img.shields.io/badge/aur-polymc--git-blue)](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/polymc-git/)
[![polymc-git](https://img.shields.io/badge/mpr-polymc--git-orange)](https://mpr.makedeb.org/packages/polymc-git)  
For Flatpak builds, you can use [flathub-beta](https://discourse.flathub.org/t/how-to-use-flathub-beta/2111).

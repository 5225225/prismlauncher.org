# Troubleshooting

This is a collection of helpful information for frequent problems when using Prism Launcher.

## Minecraft 1.16.5 with Minecraft Forge and Java 8u321+

Older versions of Minecraft Forge for Minecraft 1.16.5 cause the game to crash on launch, as they do not support the latest revisions of Java 8.

You can fix this by changing the Forge version in the launcher to the latest or recommended version.
For that go to **Version** → **Select Forge** → **Change Version** → **Select newest version** → **OK**

Alternatively you can download and use an older Java version (i.e. Java 8u320)

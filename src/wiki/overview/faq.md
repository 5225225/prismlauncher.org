# Frequently asked questions

## What happened to PolyMC? Why is there a new fork?

Prism Launcher was forked from PolyMC due to certain commits and actions taken on behalf of the project's organization.

On October 17th, 2022, LennyMcLennington ("Lenny") made [a politically charged commit](https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC/commit/ccf282593dcdbe189c99b81b8bc90cb203aed3ee) to the development branch of PolyMC. Lenny proceeded to remove every maintainer at the time and has since made it clear that he does not want anyone on the project to be supportive of his percieved left-wing ideologies. None of these changes were made with any consultation from the rest of the PolyMC team.

We at Prism Launcher adhere to our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/PrismLauncher/PrismLauncher/blob/develop/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) as we develop Prism Launcher. We do not agree with Lenny's actions, and thus have created this fork called **Prism Launcher** as a way to prevent any further politically inspired damage to the project. Locking maintainers out of the project sets a bad precedent for many of us, and does not give us good faith that the PolyMC project will remain in good hands in the future. We sincerely hope that you enjoy using Prism Launcher as we strive to deliver a consistent experience to our users.

### What does this mean for the future? Is PolyMC safe to use?

Prism Launcher will continue to have the same functionality as PolyMC did prior to [the malicious commit in question](https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC/commit/ccf282593dcdbe189c99b81b8bc90cb203aed3ee). All contributors who were removed from the project have also moved over to this one; as the end user, as long as you switch to Prism Launcher, nothing should change aside from the logo and name.

As for PolyMC, we cannot guarantee that new changes will be non-malicious or not; it is up to you whether or not you wish to continue to use the project, but we recommend against it. We suggest that you back up any important config files or instances to Prism Launcher instead of continuing to use PolyMC.

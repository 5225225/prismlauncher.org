# Downloading Modpacks

Similar to [Creating an Instance](../create-instance) downloading a modpack will use the same menu **Add Instance** or *right click > create instance* instead of just selecting your minecraft version you can instead use the side bar to select from:

* Import from zip
* ATLauncher
* CurseForge
* FTB
* FTB Legacy
* Technic

After selecting which service you will use you can browse the modpacks available to install. Importing from zip assumes you have downloaded the modpack to your computer and will ask for a .zip modpack file.

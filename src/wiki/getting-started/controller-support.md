# Making use of Controllers 

eg. Steam Deck's Gamepad

## Before proceeding

* Please ensure that you comfortable with the mod installation process within PolyMC.
* A full guide on this can be [found here](../download-mods/).
* Not all game versions are yet supported, including those before 1.12.2.
* If the instance you have created or are using is of a game version lower than 1.17, please ensure a compatable version of Java is selected. [You can learn how to do so here](../installing-java/).

Finally, if you don't have one already, you must create an **instance** with the game version and mod loader of your choice.

## Fabric

Before you continue, ensure that the correct version of the **Fabric API** mod for your instance is installed.

### For Minecraft Versions 1.16.5 to 1.18

For Minecraft 1.16.5 to 1.18 we recommend the **LambdaControls** mod.

It can be be installed using PolyMC's mod downloader funtion from either the Modrinth or CurseForge services.

Once installed, please launch your instance and navigate to the in-game controls menu.

Within the in-game controls menu, you may need to change the "Mode" setting to **Controller**, in order for the game to respond to input from the gamepad.

## Forge

For Minecraft 1.12.2 to 1.18.2 we recommend the **Controllable** mod.

### For Minecraft 1.18.1 and 1.18.2 *specifically*

You must install the Minecraft 1.18 version of the mod **directly** from CurseForge and can be found [here](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/controllable).

This is likely because the 1.18 version of the mod does not claim to support Minecraft 1.18.1 or 1.18.2, yet despite this, it should work as expected.

1.18.2 Forge is still early in development, and may have some issues.

### For Minecraft Versions 1.12.2 to 1.18

Controllable can be be installed using PolyMC's mod downloader function from the **CurseForge** service.

Once installed, you may now launch your instance, and find that the mod should begin working immediately.

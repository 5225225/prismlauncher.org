# Making use of Controllers 

This includes Steam Deck's Gamepad, PlayStation/Xbox controllers and so on.

## Before proceeding

* Please ensure that you comfortable with the mod installation process within PolyMC.
* A full guide on this can be [found here](../download-mods/).
* Not all game versions are yet supported, including those before 1.12.2.
* If the instance you have created or are using is of a game version lower than 1.17, please ensure a compatable version of Java is selected. [You can learn how to do so here](../installing-java/).

Finally, if you don't have one already, you must create an **instance** with the game version and mod loader of your choice.

## Fabric/Quilt

Before you continue, ensure that the correct version of the **Fabric API** mod on **Fabric** or the **Quilt Standard Libraries** mod on **Quilt** for your instance is installed. 

### For Minecraft Versions 1.16.5 to 1.18

For Minecraft 1.16.5 to 1.18 we recommend the **LambdaControls** mod.

It can be be installed using PolyMC's mod downloader funtion from either the Modrinth or CurseForge services.

Once installed, please launch your instance and navigate to the in-game controls menu.

Within the in-game controls menu, you may need to change the "Mode" setting to **Controller**, in order for the game to respond to input from the gamepad.

Remember to get the mapping using [**the app linked in the mod**](https://generalarcade.com/gamepadtool/)

### For Minecraft Versions 1.18.1+

Since LambdaControls got deprecated, someone decided to fork it and update it.

In fact, here we're recommending [MidnightControls](https://github.com/TeamMidnightDust/MidnightControls).

It's an updated fork of LambdaControls.

To install this mod on PolyMC, download it directly [from their GitHub releases](https://github.com/TeamMidnightDust/MidnightControls/releases) and drag-and-drop the jar in PolyMC. 

Once installed, please launch your instance and navigate to the in-game controls menu.

Within the in-game controls menu, you may need to change the "Mode" setting to **Controller**, in order for the game to respond to input from the gamepad.

Remember to get the mapping using [**the app linked in the mod**](https://generalarcade.com/gamepadtool/)

## Forge

For Minecraft 1.12.2 to 1.18.2 we recommend the **Controllable** mod.

### For Minecraft Versions 1.12.2 to 1.18.2

Controllable can be be installed using PolyMC's mod downloader function from the **CurseForge** service.

Once installed, you may now launch your instance, and find that the mod should begin working immediately.

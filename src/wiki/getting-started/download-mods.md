# Downloading Mods

Make sure you know how to [Create an Instance](../create-instance) before attempting to download modpacks.

Inside the **Edit Instance** menu select **version** from here you will need to decide what mod loader you want to use. Fabric and Forge are the most popular with Forge having the most mods. fabric and forge mods are not cross compatible so choosing between them will change your selection of mods.

Once you have picked your modloader go to the Mods tab on the left and select **Download Mods** in the mod tab's menu on the right. from here you will be able to choose from *modrinth* and *curseforge*. Modrinth supports opensource and free mods however curseforge will have a larger selection.

After you choose your mod provider you can search or browse for your desired mods. Click select mod for download to add it to your download queue from which once you press ok it will be downloaded.

## Fabric

If you have elected to use the **Fabric** mod loader, then please ensure that the latest version of the **Fabric API** mod available for your game version is installed. It is mostly **required** for Fabric mods.

If it is missing, you can find it by right clicking on your instance in PolyMC and selecting the **Edit Instance** option in the menu.

# Installing PolyMC

Installing PolyMC for most systems should be quite straightforward go to [Downloads](/download/) and click on the desired download for your operating system.

### I dont know how to open a .zip file?

Windows by default can "open" zip files but to use PolyMC you will want to make sure to extract it. to extract it right click on the file then select **Extract all...**. This should create a new folder where you extracted from which you can then open and find the polymc.exe file and run that

### Windows protected my PC?

This is normal behaviour unfortunately due to the nature of Windows app signing polymc has not purchased one yet. We may choose to do so in the future with enough funding. PolyMC is an open source launcher meaning all code can be audited if you would like to check for yourself you can do so [here](https://github.com/PolyMC/PolyMC).

If you are comfortable and trust PolyMC you can click **More info** then **Run anyway**.

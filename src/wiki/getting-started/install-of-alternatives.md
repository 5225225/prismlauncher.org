NOTE: some mods require [Fabric API](../download-mods/#fabric) to work.

## Why this

Once opon a time, OF was the best way to make your game better. Things changed.

## Sodium

[Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) is the best client side optimization mod at the moment and it's highly recommended.

To install in PolyMC, create a Fabric instance, then go to the *Mods tab* and click **Download Mods**. There, click on *Sodium*, click **Select mod for download** and then **Ok**.

## Iris

[Iris](https://irisshaders.net/) allows you to run OF Shaders while using Sodium. It works great, but it doesn't support every shaderpack at the moment.

Click [here](https://github.com/IrisShaders/Iris/blob/trunk/docs/supportedshaders.md) for a list of currently supported shaderpacks

To install in PolyMC, create a Fabric instance, then go to the *Mods tab* and click **Download Mods**. There, click on *Iris*, click **Select mod for download** and then **Ok**.

## Other Mods

If you want to improve your performance, consider installing [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) and [Starlight](https://modrinth.com/mod/starlight)!

We can't list every mod here, but you can find a big list of optifine alternatives [here](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives/).

# Fabulously Optimized

If you don't want to search and install these mods manually, the [Fabulously Optimized](https://github.com/Fabulously-Optimized/fabulously-optimized) modpack is for you!

See the MultiMC/MultiMC (auto-update) guide to install it, they work on PolyMC too.

# Note about Forge

Unlike on fabric, unofficial forge ports of fabric optimization mods are low-quality and generally not recommended (except [RoadRunner](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/roadrunner) and [LazyDFU Forge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/lazy-dfu-forge))

Except these mods, and other mods like [EntityCulling](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/entityculling), [FerriteCore for Forge](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ferritecore) and [Starlight for Forge](https://modrinth.com/mod/starlight-forge), you should prefer OptiFine on forge.

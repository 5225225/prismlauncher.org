# Installing Java

Java is required to be able to run minecraft as such until 1.2.0 is released you will need to manually install java to run minecraft under PolyMC.

https://adoptium.net/ is what we currently reccomend to install the latest versions of java. Minecraft 1.17 and upwards will require Temurin 17 (LTS) anything below will require Temurin 8 (LTS).

* 1.17+ **Temurin 17 (LTS)**
* Pre-classic - 1.16.5 **Temurin 8 (LTS)**

It is reccomended to just install both if you are unsure.

## Using Java
once downloaded polymc will be able to detect your java installs in the first time wizard. if you installed Java after already completing the first time wizard you can access your Java configuration through 
> Settings > Java > Java Runtime > Auto-detect...

# Installing Java

Java is **required** in order to run Minecraft, as such, until PolyMC 1.2.0 is released, you **will** need to **manually** install Java to run Minecraft with PolyMC.

Currently, we recommend heading over to [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/) to install the latest versions of Java. Minecraft 1.17 and upwards will require **Temurin 17 (LTS)** while anything below will require **Temurin 8 (LTS).**

* 1.17+ **Temurin 17 (LTS)**
* Pre-classic - 1.16.5 **Temurin 8 (LTS)**

If you aren't sure which version you will need, **it is recommended to just install both.**

## Using Java
Once you have downloaded and **installed** Java, PolyMC will be able to detect it during the first time set-up wizard. 

If you installed Java after already completing the first time wizard, you can access your Java configuration through 
> Settings > Java > Java Runtime > Auto-detect...

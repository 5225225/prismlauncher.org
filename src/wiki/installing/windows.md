## Installing PolyMC's Official Archive

While installing this version of PolyMC on **Windows** should be relatively simple, you will need to know how to extract a **.zip** archive file.

To begin, navigate to our downloads page, and choose the "Download" (or "Download (Portable)") under the **Windows** heading.

Your browser should ask you if you would prefer to save or open the archive. Please choose a location on your system where you'd like the downloaded file to go, and then select the **save** option.

Once the download has completed, navigate to the location of the downloaded file, **right-click** on it, and choose the "**Extract All...**" option.

Once the extraction operation has completed, PolyMC should launch after you **double-click** on the file named **polymc.exe**.

### Creating a Shortcut

If you wish to have a shortcut to PolyMC for use on your desktop for example, you can create one by **right-clicking** on **polymc.exe**, and choosing the **Create Shortcut** option within the context menu.

You may now **move** or **copy** the created shortcut to any desired location on your system.

## Issues

### A Note on Legacy Windows Support (Windows 7, 8)


While it may be **possible** to install PolyMC on these legacy operating systems, it is **not recommended, nor is it officially supported**. We may or may not choose to provide support for any issues you encounter.

PolyMC does currently work on Windows 7, however, support could break at any time.

If you want a more technical explanation, it's because msys2 and Cygwin, that we use for building PolyMC on Windows, will start targeting 8.1 ([see this](https://www.msys2.org/docs/windows_support/)).

Anyways, you should probably stop using Windows 7, especially since [ESU support will end](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/lifecycle/products/windows-7) soon.

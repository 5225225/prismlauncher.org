It is recommended to install third-party software via Flatpak on the Steam Deck.
This can be done by searching for `PolyMC` in the Discover software center in *Desktop Mode*.

After installing PolyMC, set it up as usual.
When you are done open up Steam (still in *Desktop Mode*), click on `Games` in the menubar and then click on `Add a Non-Steam Game to My Library...`.
There you can find and select `PolyMC` and click `ADD SELECTED PROGRAMS`.
Now you should have PolyMC in your Steam Library.

## Tips and Tricks

- For the best experience, go ahead and enable `Start Minecraft maximized` and `Close PolyMC after game window opens` in the launcher's settings under the `Minecraft` tab.
- Install a mod that enables controller support. See [Controller Support](../../getting-started/controller-support)
